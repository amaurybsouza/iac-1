Infrastructure as Code
======================

Infrastructure as code, also referred to as IaC, is a type of IT setup wherein developers or operations teams automatically manage and provision the technology stack for an application through software, rather than using a manual process to configure discrete hardware devices and operating systems.

The key features of the repository are:

- **Deliver Stable Environments**: Rapidly and at scale.

- **Avoid Manual Configuration**:  Enforce consistency by representing the desired state of the environments via code.

- **Repeatable Deployments**: Prevent runtime issues caused by configuration drift or missing dependencies.

- **Use Terraform**: Terraform is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

For more information, see the [introduction section](http://www.terraform.io/intro) of the Terraform website.
